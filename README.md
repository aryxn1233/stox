Automated Trading Bot Project
This repository contains the code for an automated trading bot designed to execute trades on financial markets based on predefined strategies and visualize market data.

üöÄ Project Goal
As previously defined, the core goal of this project is:

"To develop and deploy a robust, automated trading bot capable of executing trades on a specified financial market (e.g., cryptocurrency, stocks, forex) based on predefined, rule-based strategies. The primary objective is to achieve a consistent, positive return on investment (ROI) over a defined period (e.g., monthly/quarterly), while effectively managing risk through programmed stop-loss and position sizing mechanisms, thereby minimizing manual intervention and emotional trading biases."

‚ú® Features
Automated Trading Execution: Executes buy/sell orders based on pre-configured trading strategies and market signals.

Real-time Charting: Displays live and historical market data (e.g., candlestick charts) for analysis.

Strategy Management: Allows for the definition and selection of different trading strategies.

Risk Management: Implements stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing to control exposure.

Performance Tracking: Monitors and reports on trade history, profit/loss, and other key metrics.

User Interface: A responsive web interface for monitoring the bot's activity and market conditions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend (Python)
Python: The core language for the trading logic, data processing, and API interactions.

Financial Libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy): For data manipulation and analytical calculations.

Trading/Brokerage APIs (e.g., CCXT, Alpaca-py): For connecting to exchanges/brokers and executing trades.

Web Framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI): For building RESTful APIs to communicate with the frontend.

WebSocket Library (e.g., websockets): For real-time data streaming to the frontend.

Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite): For storing historical data, trade logs, and configuration.

Frontend (React)
React: For building the interactive user interface.

Charting Library (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js, D3.js): For rendering dynamic and responsive financial charts.

State Management (e.g., Zustand, React Context API): For managing application state.

WebSocket Client (e.g., ws or browser's native WebSocket API): For receiving real-time market data from the backend.

Styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components): For a clean and responsive design.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)

npm or yarn

Access to a trading exchange/brokerage API (with API keys)

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-trading-bot-repo.git
cd your-trading-bot-repo

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt # Create a requirements.txt from your Python project

(If you don't have requirements.txt, you'll need to pip install each library mentioned in "Technologies Used" under Backend.)

Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the backend root directory and add your API keys and other sensitive information.

# Example .env content for backend
EXCHANGE_API_KEY="YOUR_EXCHANGE_API_KEY"
EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./trading_bot.db" # Or your PostgreSQL connection string
# ... other configurations

Run database migrations (if applicable):

# Example for Flask-Migrate or SQLAlchemy Alembic
flask db upgrade

Start the backend server:

# Example for Flask/FastAPI
python app.py # or uvicorn main:app --reload

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend # or wherever your React app lives

Install JavaScript dependencies:

npm install # or yarn install

Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the frontend directory to point to your backend API.

# Example .env.local content for React app
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:5000" # Or your deployed backend URL
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL="ws://localhost:5000/ws" # Or your deployed WebSocket URL

Start the frontend development server:

npm start # or yarn start (for Create React App)
npm run dev # or yarn dev (for Next.js)

The application should now be running in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000 (frontend) and http://localhost:5000 (backend API).

üöÄ Usage
Start Backend: Ensure your Python backend server is running.

Start Frontend: Open the frontend application in your web browser.

Configure Strategies: Use the UI to define or select your desired trading strategies.

Monitor Charts: Observe real-time market data and bot activity on the charts.

Review Performance: Check trade logs and performance metrics to evaluate the bot's effectiveness.
